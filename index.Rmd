*Question 2*

```{r Q2, echo=FALSE}
question("The above R Markdown runs fine, but is missing the point of R Markdown. Why?",
  answer("The comments should be part of the text outside the R chunks. That way, an R Markdown document can become a proper report",correct=TRUE),
  answer("With R Markdown, all the libraries are already preloaded, so there's no need to have commands that load libraries!", message="No, you still need to load libraries in an R Markdown file"),
  answer("R Markdown is made for writing R code. Ideally, we shouldn't have any text or comment in such document, so that it is reproducible", message="No, the advantage of R Markdown is that it is great for writing reproducible reports. So it should contain text"),
  answer("The commands should all be included in the same R chunk, so that they can be run altogether. That's the beauty of R Markdown!", message="No, having all the commands inside one unique R chunk would be missing the point as well."), allow_retry = TRUE,random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```


*Question 3*

  answer("There shouldn't be any gap between rows or columns, other than for missing values", correct=TRUE),
  answer("All the columns should have the same length, and the same for the rows", correct=TRUE),
